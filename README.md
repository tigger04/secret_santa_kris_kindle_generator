# secret_santa_kris_kindle_generator
CLI for generating random matches for kriskindle (also known as 'Secret Santa'), with options for specifying matches to avoid (e.g. where one half of a couple should not be allocated their partner) and must-matches or fixes (maybe you had to allocate somebody out of a hat separately for practical reasons). Results are stored in an output file by default for later reference. Ho Ho Ho! 🎅🏻🦌🛷☃️❄️
